This GIT serves as a branch of Caravel, containing all code concerning the creation, setup and use of Ardor3D on Android.

In it's current state, it's far from finished, let alone readable.
However, things it contains at the moment are:

- Texture Atlas
- Model/Texture loading mechanism, with possibility for themes
- Mesh combine
- Low-poly water effect
- Graph implementation
- Orbit Camera
- User Interface
- Multi-touch input: pinch-to-zoom.
- Loading screen / Splash screen

I left 1 model in the program, so it still works
